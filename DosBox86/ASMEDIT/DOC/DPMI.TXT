DPMI usage and problems related to that
=======================================

This file describes the programs RTM.EXE and DPMI16BI.OVL. You can copy and
use these files under the same terms as the software licence by Borland Pascal.

1. Running a DOS protected mode program
---------------------------------------

If you run a protected mode (PM) program be sure to keep the the files
DPMI16BI.OVL (the DPMI host), RTM.EXE (the DPMI loader) and all application
DLLs in one of the following places:

- the current directory
- the same directory as the application
- in the search PATH.


2. DPMI host DPMI16BI.OVL
-------------------------

Per default the DPMI host will allocate all available extended memory.
To aviod this you can set an environment variable to give an upper boundary.
You can write the following line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT:

  SET DPMIMEM=MAXMEMxxxx

where xxxx is the amount of memory in KByte.

If you have for instance 4 MByte Memory installed and you will give the DPMI
host only 2 MByte of it, define the environment as follows:

  SET DPMIMEM=MAXMEM2048


These lines are already in AE.BAT. Please adjust them, if you use this batch
file to start ASM Edit.


3. Control memory via DPMI loader
---------------------------------

The DPMI loader tries to give you the maximum amount of conventional memory
before running an application. RTM will move memory blocks to extended
memory but doesn't free them again. If you want to use other PM programs
you can set the environment variable RTM.

   Option          Description
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   EXTLEAVExxxx    Leave xxxx Kbyte extended memory. Default is 640 kByte.

   EXTMAXxxxx      xxxx KByte extended memory will be allocated. Default
                   is 4 GByte.

   EXTMINxxxx      If there are less than xxxx KByte memory after
                   consideration of EXTMAX and EXTLEAVE the program will
                   be terminated with 'Out of memory". Default is 0.

   REALLEAVEnnnn   Leave nnnn paragraphs DOS memory. Default is 4096
                   paragraphs, which is 64 KByte.

   REALMAXnnnn     nnnn paragraphs will be allocated. Default is 65535,
                   which is 1 MByte.

   REALMINnnnn     If there are less than nnnn KByte memory after
                   consideration of REALMAX and REALLEAVE the program will
                   be terminated with 'Out of memory". Default is 0.

With the following line RTM allocates a maximum amount of 2 MByte extended
memory and leaves 128 KByte DOS memory:

  SET RTM=EXTMAX2048 REALLEAVE8192


4. How to use 32bit DPMI if 16 bit fails
----------------------------------------

If you experience problems with the 16 bit DPMI host provided by ASM Edit
try to use another DPMI host.

- Use Quarterdecks QPDMI host. 
  (refer to your manual of Quarterdeck how to include the DPMI device driver
  in your config.sys)
- Use 32RTM.EXE and DPMI32VM.OVL (e.g. from Borland C++).
- use the DPMIRES program shipped with many Borland tools.

Note that you have to set the environment variables DPMI32 instead of 
DPMIMEM to adjust your DPMI memory.

Example:  SET DPMI32=MAXMEM4096


5. DPMI in a Windows DOS box
----------------------------

Make sure that you load the DPMI host AFTER starting the DOS box, but BEFORE
starting ASM Edit. Please use a PIF file.


6. DPMI in a OS/2 DOS box
-------------------------

Simple enable the settings for DPMI and select a proper amount of memory (e.g. 
4-8 MByte). That's all.
