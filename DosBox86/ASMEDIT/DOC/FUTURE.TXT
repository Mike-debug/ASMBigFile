That's what we would implement if we had the time...

- auto save function
- smart skipping of assembly/linking with file exist & date/time compare
- scheduler in Idle(), for background operations
- folding of procedures and macros
- native OS/2 version
- HEX Editor
- colored view of difference between two files
- ??? Do *you* know?
