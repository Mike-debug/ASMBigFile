  v1.8 you get all versions up to v1.89 for FREE, but NOT v1.9)
- You can get technical support and help.
- You can order upgrades for further versions for a reduced price.

For private use the full version of ASM Edit is registered to you.

If you don't own a printer you can write the most important items on a sheat
of paper:
- current version of ASM Edit
- your (REAL!) name and address
  (for governmental or commercial use: add name of firm or institute, too)
- if you have one: your e-mail address
- how you are going to pay
- your signature

Send your order form along with the money to the following address:

        Olaf Krusche
        Sportlerweg 7
        02692 Doberschau
        Germany

If you want to transfer the money via direct money transfer from bank to 
bank or pay via credit card, send an e-mail to <ok3@irz.inf.tu-dresden.de>.


Upgrading
=========

If you order a full version of ASM Edit you will be notified by us of new ASM 
Edit versions. You can then upgrade to the new version for a reduced price.


Payment
=======

Cash:
- DM (Deutsche Mark - German Marks)
- US Dollar (A money order is not cash!)
- other currencies: Please read the file "PRICES.TXT".
  If you want to pay with a currency that is not covered by that file,
  do the following: Convert the DM amount (including cheque surcharge
  if you pay by cheque or money order, see below) to your own currency
  using the most current (today's) exchange rate, then add 5%.
- Do NOT send any coins, bananas, chocolade etc., because we can't exchange
  them.

Cheque:
- Eurocheque: Please note the amount in DM so no extra surcharge is required.
- Foreign cheque or money order (+ 10 $US or 15 DM): These kind of cheques
  involve high costs for us, therefore you have to add another 10 $US or 15 DM
  surcharge if you pay this way. Use this way if you don't want to send cash
  through the mail (although you could send it as "registered mail" or
  "recorded delivery") and if you can't pay by Eurocheque.

It is not possible to pay by C.O.D. (cash on delivery). We won't accept 
International Money Transfer, because it is rather slow (depending on the 
country), and it involves high costs for us (18 DM, that's about 12 $US).

(Thanks go to Oliver Fromme, author of QPV - Quick Picture Viewer, for his
help in this matter.)
