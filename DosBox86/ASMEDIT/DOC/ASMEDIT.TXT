1. What is ASM Edit?
--------------------

ASM Edit is a DOS based easy-to-use IDE for all you assembler freaks out
there.

2. Requirements
---------------

ASM Edit requires:
- 80386
- VGA
- at least DOS 3.0
- about 500 Kbyte free DOS memory
- 4096 KByte free disk space to install

Recommended:
- 80486 DX-33
- SVGA with VESA support
- DOS 5.0
- 1024 KByte free memory (XMS or EMS)
- additional 4096 KByte free disk space for swap file

If you get messages like "Runtime error 251: No startup possible" or "DPMI 
error while allocating real memory" you need more conventional memory. Please 
unload some TSR or device drivers or adjust the settings of your DOS box.


3. DPMI usage
-------------

Since v1.8 ASM Edit has been using Borland's DPMI16BI.OVL as 16-bit DPMI host.
This way all of your memory can be used for work. If you want to use other
DPMI programs (started via ASM Edit) write the following lines to your
AUTOEXEC.BAT or enter them at the command prompt:

        SET DPMIMEM=MAXMEMxxxx
        SET RTM=EXTLEAVEyyyy

where xxxx is the maximum amount of memory all DPMI programs can use for
themselves and yyyy is the amount of memory the RTM loader leaves for other
programs. (on a 16 MByte system: xxxx=4096 and yyyy=2096)

The file AE.BAT contains the two lines already, please modify it to match
your system.

If you encounter problems with other DPMI programs, especially 32-bit ones
(e.g. Borland's TLINK.EXE) set up a DPMI host yourself before starting
ASM Edit: Use Quarterdeck's QDPMI.SYS (run it via CONFIG.SYS) and/or
Borland's DPMIRES.EXE (start it at the command prompt). After that you
can start ASM Edit and it should work fine. As long as a DPMI using
program provides you with the feature you can also disable the usage of
DPMI.

4. ASM Edit and the various Operating Systems
---------------------------------------------

ASM Edit runs fine under pure DOS, OS/2, Windows 3.1/3.11, Windows 95,
Windows NT and various DOS emulators (e.g. AIX RISC 6000).

However, there are some important details for the external programs called
by ASM Edit. This is mostly due to the DPMI interface and/or the complex
settings possible for the DOS boxes by OS/2 and Windows. Please refer in
the online Help of ASM Edit to the topics 'Configuring ASM Edit' and
'Tutorial'.

For OS/2 you will find the file 'OS2_SETT.TXT' which can be loaded in the
'Settings dialog' - 'Session' - 'DOS Settings' via the 'Load' Button. The
most important setting is the DPMI Interface. It should always be set to
'Enabled' to avoid problems with TLINK v3.1 and other programs. Please
adjust the memory amounts to your system. The numbers in 'OS2_SETT.TXT' are
optimized for a 16 MByte system.

Note: Don't forget to adjust the settings for all programs from which you
want to start ASM Edit, e.g. Norton Commander!

Most problems with Windows 95 in earlier versions have been fixed. But:
Depending on the video driver you are using it is not possible to run
ASM Edit windowed. Before testing the editor with Windows 95 create a PIF
file for it by right-clicking on ASM Edit's icon and choosing 'Preferences'
from the pop-up menu. In the 'Screen' section you will find a check box.
Enable 'Full screen' and you should be able to run ASM Edit. After that try
to run ASM Edit windowed by pressing <Alt>+<Enter>. If you get a message
saying 'It is not possible to run this application windowed...' your video
driver isn't compatible with ASM Edit.

It is recommended to use ASM Edit under plain DOS to develop native assembler
programs, because buggy assembler code (as often experienced in early stages)
can lock-up Windows 95.

5. Getting started - Tutorial
-----------------------------

Before you can work with ASM Edit you have to configure it. Select all external
programs and enter the working directories as described in ASM Edit's Tutorial.
You will find it in the help menu or in the help index under 'Tutorial'.

6. The Editor
-------------

ASM Edit uses our own handmade editor. Depending on your memory size (XMS, EMS
and disk space) you can edit files largeer than 256 MB. The editor correctly
handles all files, regardless of line length or number of lines. 

DOS and Unix text files can be loaded and saved, converting them in the
process. You are even able to edit part of executables, such as COM or EXE
files. Refer to 'Options - Preferences - Editor' for further info.

7. Using external programs
--------------------------

OK, we have a nice looking assembler source file. Now what?

ASM Edit is able to run external programs for assembling, linking and
debugging that source file. The default options set in 'Options - External
programs' are for use with Borland's Turbo Assembler, Turbo Linker and Turbo
Debugger. But you can change these options in the mentioned menu to use
*your* favourite programs.

Errors in your piece of work? No problem!

After assembling an error file is created by the external programs. This file
(tested with Borland's TASM, Microsoft's MASM and WATCOM's WASM) is read by
ASM Edit and displayed in a new window. You can choose any of these errors and
the line containing the error will be automatically shown in an editor window.

8. Tools - Disassembler
-----------------------

Do you know the ASCII code for '@'? No? There is an ASCII chart in ASM Edit.
A larger representation of the chosen character is shown along with the
decimal and hexadecimal number.

No batteries for your little pocket calculator? Use the one in ASM Edit. You
can set the number format to decimal, hexadecimal or binary and choose the
range between BYTE, WORD, DWORD or QWORD. The operations of the calculator
cover not only the numeric ones, you can also shift or rotate the numbers.

Problems with converting numbers? Use ASM Edit's converter. Up to 20 digits
are shown in hexadecimal, descimal, binary and ASCII format. And: The opcode
represented through the given numbers will be shown! With this feature you
can disassemble short code pieces.

Do you have a favourite tool not covered with ASM Edit? Include it via the
'Options - Tools' menu. A new entry will appear in the 'Tools' menu.

9. The Help System
------------------

Still confused?

ASM Edit comes with a large help file. All assembler mnemonics up to the new
Pentium Pro (686), FPU and MMX instructions, EGA/VGA/VESA programming, a hugh
interrupt list, DOS tables and formats, and much more, are described in the
help.

To take a short look at it press <Shift>+<F1> to get ASM Edit's help index
with over 600 entries. Type in a word you want to search for...

Press <Ctrl>+<F1> if you want help on the current word (the one under the
editor cursor). ASM Edit searches through its index to the nearest letter
combination. If it matches the given word it will open the help topic. This
even works in the converter, using the instruction line.

10. Technical details
---------------------

ASM Edit was written with Borland Pascal 7.0 and Turbo Vision v2.0 at the
Technical University Dresden, Germany.

It consists now of about 2.4 MByte source code and additional programs/texts.
The help file's unpacked size is over 1 MByte. ASM Edit uses an DPMI
host/interface with a handmade swapfile management to provide you as much
memory as your computer holds for editing. Its ASM Shell realizes a virtual
video screen to capture all output from external programs.
